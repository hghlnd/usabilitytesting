            <h3>Introduction (5 minutes)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Welcome the Participant:</strong><br>
                "Hi [Participant's Name], thank you for taking the time to join us today. My name is Oscar, and I’ll be moderating this session. Before we begin, let me explain a bit about how this test will work."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose of the Test:</strong><br>
                "Today, we’re testing the usability of the Khan Academy website. The goal is to understand how easy or difficult it is to use the website and identify areas for improvement. Please remember, this is not a test of your skills; it’s the website we’re evaluating. So feel free to be honest in your feedback. Your input is incredibly valuable."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Logistics:</strong><br>
                "This session will take about 40 minutes. I’ll ask you to complete a few tasks on the website, and I’ll be observing how you interact with it. Don’t worry about making mistakes; they’re actually helpful for us to learn. If you have questions during the tasks, I may not answer right away because I want to see how you navigate the site independently. After each task, I’ll ask for your feedback."
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Consent and Recording:</strong><br>
                "This session will be recorded for research purposes only. The recordings are confidential and will not be shared outside the research team. Do I have your consent to proceed with the recording?" 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pre-Test Questions:</strong><br>
                "Before we start, I have a few quick questions to understand your background better:"<br>
                - Have you used Khan Academy before?<br>
                - If yes, what do you typically use it for?<br>
                - How often do you use educational websites?<br>
                - On a scale of 1 to 5, how comfortable are you with technology (1 being not comfortable at all, and 5 being very comfortable)?
            </p>
