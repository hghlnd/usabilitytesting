            <h2>Six Recommendations</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Improve Accessibility Features</h3>
            <p>
                Relocate accessibility settings to a more prominent position on the homepage or within the main navigation bar. 
                Provide quick access toggles for common settings like text size adjustment, dark mode, and captions to ensure 
                users can find and use them effortlessly.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Address Mobile Usability Issues</h3>
            <p>
                Optimize mobile navigation by fixing non-functional buttons, such as "skip question" and "show answer." 
                Introduce a persistent menu or shortcut bar for easier access to key features like subjects, progress tracking, 
                and settings.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Streamline Progress Tracking and Streak Features</h3>
            <p>
                Enhance the streak tracking feature by integrating a visual progress dashboard that combines streaks, 
                completed lessons, and achieved milestones. Introduce gamified elements like badges or certificates 
                for milestones (e.g., completing a subject unit or maintaining a streak for consecutive days). 
                Provide a detailed breakdown of progress by subject and grade level to motivate users.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Refine Navigation for Switching Subjects</h3>
            <p>
                Add a dropdown menu or side panel within lessons that allows users to switch between subjects or grades 
                without exiting the current lesson. Include a clear breadcrumb trail showing the userâ€™s current location 
                (e.g., "Subject > Grade Level > Lesson") to improve navigation clarity.
            </p>
            
            <h3>5. Improve Password Security During Sign-Up</h3>
            <p>
                Enforce stronger password requirements during account creation, such as a minimum of 8 characters, 
                mandatory inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide real-time 
                validation with green/red indicators to guide users during password setup.
            </p>
            
            <h3>6. Reduce Visual Clutter and Intrusive Elements</h3>
            <p>
                Redesign the large blue banner on the homepage to be smaller or collapsible, allowing users to hide 
                it after their first interaction. Ensure that critical homepage content remains visible without 
                requiring users to scroll past intrusive elements.
