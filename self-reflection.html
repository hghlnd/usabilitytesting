            <h2>Self Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This was my first time conducting any kind of usability test, and I’ll admit I was pretty nervous going into it. 
                During the first interview, I found myself fumbling a bit, even though I had a script to follow. I was so focused 
                on trying to do everything "right" that I ended up jumbling the order of some questions and tasks. It wasn’t as 
                smooth as I hoped, and I kept worrying about whether I was capturing the right information.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the time I got to the second interview, I started to feel more at ease. Having gone through the process once, 
                I was better prepared for how things could go off script or take unexpected turns. I realized it was okay to adapt 
                and that the main goal was to gather insights, not to follow the script word for word. The last interview felt 
                almost effortless compared to the first. I was able to stay calm, listen more carefully to the participant, and 
                even improvise when needed without feeling flustered.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest lessons I learned was that preparation is important, but flexibility is just as crucial. 
                Usability testing isn’t always linear, and participants sometimes bring up points you didn’t anticipate. Being 
                able to adapt and go with the flow while still staying focused on the goal is a skill I’m glad I started to 
                develop through this process.
            </p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts on Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                This experience gave me a newfound appreciation for how much goes into creating a user-friendly platform. It’s 
                easy to take intuitive interfaces for granted until you see where users struggle and realize those "small details" 
                can make a big difference. Usability testing is more than just observing—it’s about understanding the user’s 
                perspective and using that insight to create meaningful improvements.
