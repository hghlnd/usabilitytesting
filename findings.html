            <h2>Findings</h2>
            
            <h3>User #1</h3>
            <p>
                User #1 found the overall usability of Khan Academy to be intuitive but noted areas for improvement. 
                The user signed up easily within the first 2 minutes (2:00). They found the website intuitive 
                initially but became slightly overwhelmed by the number of options presented on the homepage, which took some 
                time to navigate (3:00). They reported that switching between subjects like Math and Science 
                was simple and effective (8:00) but struggled to switch between subjects during lessons, suggesting 
                an improvement (10:00).
            </p>
            <p>
                User #1 appreciated immediate feedback for correct answers during quizzes (7:00) and preferred 
                immediate notifications for right answers during tests instead of waiting until the end (16:00). 
                They noted that accessibility features were hidden and suggested placing them more prominently (19:00). 
                The explore page was praised for being intuitive (23:00). Additionally, account recovery was smooth 
                and efficient (26:00). The search function was user-friendly and yielded relevant results 
                (29:00). On mobile, the lessons were functional, but navigation between subjects was harder, 
                and some buttons did not work as intended (37:00).
            </p>

            <h3>User #2</h3>
            <p>
                User #2 had a positive experience with Khan Academy but suggested minor refinements. They described the sign-up 
                process as "super easy" and had no issues (3:55). It was easy to pick and sign up for classes 
                (6:05). They found the interface intuitive for starting lessons (6:34) 
                but mentioned that the large blue bubble on the homepage obscured content, creating initial confusion 
                (6:59).
            </p>
            <p>
                The user appreciated the progress bar and described it as helpful (9:11). They thought that the 
                interface made it easy to find quizzes (13:42) and preferred immediate feedback on whether 
                answers were correct (14:50). They reported that accessibility settings were somewhat hard 
                to locate and suggested moving them to a more prominent position (16:50, 17:58). 
                They found the homepage navigation to be straightforward (19:51) and praised the search feature 
                for narrowing results effectively (21:40).
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding mobile usage, User #2 found the app to be seamless and easier to use than the desktop version 
                (28:00). They did not suggest any major improvements for the mobile experience 
                (29:22).
            </p>

            <h3>User #3</h3>
            <p>
                User #3 found the platform useful but identified areas needing improvement. They noticed layout spacing issues 
                on the top of the website, which caused content to feel condensed (3:46). They found the 
                sign-up process intuitive (5:00) but noted that password requirements were not stringent 
                enough, as they signed up using a weak password (8:28).
            </p>
            <p>
                This user appreciated the streak feature that tracked login activity (9:40) but struggled 
                when selecting the grade level for lessons, describing it as more difficult than expected (10:16). 
                They found the quiz order confusing (19:05) and remarked that the left-hand column was not labeled 
                properly, making it harder to find quizzes (21:45). They suggested that accessibility settings 
                should be more visible and that the platform could benefit from an FAQ section (25:12, 
                25:54).
            </p>
            <p>
                User #3 noted that switching between learner and teacher modes should require locked permissions (26:29). 
                On mobile, they found the interface cleaner but harder to navigate due to condensed content (35:25). 
                Some buttons on mobile, such as "skip question" or "show answer," did not work as expected (37:57). 
                Finally, they mentioned that the blue banner on the homepage was intrusive and could be improved (41:37).

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h3>Summary of User Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                The user interviews provided valuable insights into the practical usability of Khan Academy. 
                Participants appreciated the platform's intuitive design, effective feedback system, and progress tracking features. 
                However, they identified key areas for improvement, including the accessibility settings, navigation for switching 
                subjects, mobile usability, and password security. These findings highlight opportunities to enhance the platform's 
                overall user experience, particularly for diverse user groups, such as students, educators, and mobile learners.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Khan Academy is a highly functional and user-friendly platform that aligns well with Nielsenâ€™s Usability Heuristics. 
                The strengths include its intuitive navigation, effective error prevention, and clean, minimalist design. However, 
                the following key issues require attention to enhance usability and engagement:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility Features (Severity: 3):</strong> Improve visibility and accessibility for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Usability (Severity: 4):</strong> Resolve critical navigation and functionality issues on mobile.</li>
                <li><strong>Progress Tracking (Severity: 2):</strong> Add gamified elements to enhance engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation for Switching Subjects (Severity: 3):</strong> Streamline transitions between subjects and add breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Password Security (Severity: 3):</strong> Strengthen account security measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Homepage Clutter (Severity: 2):</strong> Simplify the design to maintain visual clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By addressing these areas, Khan Academy can further solidify its position as a leading educational platform, ensuring an 
                inclusive, engaging, and secure experience for all users.
